# 🧠 Killing Grade 12 Informatics Practices  
So you don't have to.  

---

Welcome to the graveyard of braincells.  

This repo is the byproduct of a 2-day deathmatch with the CBSE-NCERT Grade 12 Informatics Practices syllabus.
It's got just enough Python, Pandas, SQL, and digital bullshit to pass, flex, or forget.  

Whether you're a tired student, a masochistic autodidact, or just here for the passing time- **this will save you time, sanity, and the existential dread of figuring out how `GROUP BY` works at 3 AM.**
