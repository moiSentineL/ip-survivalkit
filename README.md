# 🧠 Killing Grade 12 Informatics Practices  
So you don't have to.  

---

Welcome to the graveyard of braincells.  

This repo is the byproduct of a 2-day deathmatch with the CBSE-NCERT Grade 12 Informatics Practices syllabus.
It's got just enough Python, Pandas, SQL, and digital bullshit to pass, flex, or forget.  

Whether you're a tired student, a masochistic autodidact, or just here for the passing time- **this will save you time, sanity, and the existential dread of figuring out how `GROUP BY` works at 3 AM.**

## 🗂 What's in here?

- 🐼 `pandas/` – Because spreadsheets weren’t painful enough.
- 📊 `matplotlib/` – Now you can draw lines and pretend it’s science.
- 🐘 `sql/` – SQLite scripts and queries to abuse with your SELECT rage.
- 📔 `notes/` - small, concise revision notes for each topic.
- 💾 `assets/` - sample `csv` and `db` files for your varied use cases.

<!-- 🎥 `livestream/` – Setup, configs, and painlog from the YouTube speedrun. -->

**I will/have covered every single topic from the CBSE Grade 12 IP [Curriculum](curriculum.pdf)**.
