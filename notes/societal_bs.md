## Societal BS you have to remember for exams
### Digital Footprints
Everything that you do on the internet leaves a trail.

For example, if you comment on a YouTube channel, and then later delete it, it's highly likely that it is still on the server/or someone's screenshot.

So, that's a "footprint"
### Digital Society and Netizen
"How to be a better internet user and communicator."
- following etiquettes: like being respectful, following the server rules, etc.
- being careful that you don't meet/be friends with weird people.
### Data Protection
- Intellectual Property: something that someone has created.
	- Example: a game (say, GTA V), a novel, a machine, etc.
- Protected by:
	- Copyright: you can't copy it w/o permission
	- Patents: you can't reproduce the thing
	- Trademarks: I really forgot
	- Licensing: determines how the property should be used.
### Open Sourcing
Sometimes softwares and resources are made available for the public for any use. The source code (the original code) is open. That's why it's called open-source.
### Licensing
Licenses determine how the software/intellectual property should be used, and provides protection.
#### Public Licenses
You have an open-source software, you can use a license to regulate things a bit. 

Three main public licenses:
- GNU GPL v3
- MIT License
- Apache License
#### Creative Commons Licenses
These are specifically for creation and providing licensing regulation for shared information. 

>"Creative Commons is an international nonprofit organization that empowers people to grow and sustain the thriving commons of shared knowledge and culture we need to address the world's most pressing challenges and create a brighter future for all."

### Cyber Crime
You use computer for crime = Cyber Crime.
- **Phishing**: using fraud, real looking websites/interfaces to scam and trap people.
	- Check the URL and be careful.
- **Identity Theft**: someone using *your* debit card/aadhar/PAN/something to commit crimes. That's BAD.
- **Hacking**: you already know.
- **Ransomware**: blackmailing, but on a cyber level. Like taking your important files but not giving it you... refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack
### Indian Information Technology Act (IT Act)
This was amended in 2008 to prevent cyber crime and make online transactions and dilly-dallying more secure.
### E-waste: Hazards and  Management
E-waste? A piece of technology that is discarded and not in use.

Why it is harmful? 
- if you don't dispose of it properly, the harmful materials like plastic, beryllium, cadmium, lead, etc. will harm the environment and YOU.

Use the 3R (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) to manage e-waste.
### Impact on Health from Tech
- Things can get very messy if you don't pay attention to your posture and ergonomics.
- And eyes, of course. That's why your parents get annoyed when you play BGMI too much.
